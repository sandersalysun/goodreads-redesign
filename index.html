                                        <li>Megan suggested logging individual chapters of textbooks for academic purposes, while Summer wanted to link Goodreads with her school email.</li>
                                        <li>Sam and Nathan expressed dissatisfaction with the app’s algorithm, noting its tendency to recommend only the most popular books, which sometimes clashed with their personal preferences.</li>

I used a chatbot to help identify the five most communicated points of pain from users. Using AI in this process helped me eliminate any bias I may have held about the app. After identifying these pain points, I needed to make sure I addressed these issues in my design requirements. </p>

                                    <h4>1. Difficult Navigation:</h4> 
                                        <p>Users consistently reported difficulty navigating the app. Many had to click through multiple menus to reach desired features, and they found that certain sections (like profile pages or reading lists) were buried deep in the interface.</p>     

                                    <h4>2. Outdated Interface:</h4> 
                                        <p>Users frequently mention the outdated design, with a bland and cluttered appearance that lacks modern UI features like dark mode. Both surveys and interviews indicated that the app looks "dated" and "ugly," with a beige color palette and rigid, sharp squares contributing to an unpleasant visual experience.</p>

                                    <h4>3. Poor Social Features:</h4> 
                                        <p>A recurring theme was dissatisfaction with the social features, specifically how difficult it is to connect with friends. Users also felt that once they connected, there was little they could do with those connections, making the social experience passive and unengaging.</p>

                                    <h4>4. Overwhelming and Poor Discoverability:</h4> 
                                        <p>The app overwhelms users with features, and finding new books is difficult due to impersonal and inaccurate recommendations that are not tailored to users reading preferences. </p>

                                    <h4>5. Slowness and Glitches:</h4> 
                                        <p>Many users, particularly in the interviews, complained about frequent glitches and long load times, which sometimes caused them to give up on the app entirely.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p> I have begun the prototyping phase by designing wireframes that incorporate the solutions outlined above:

                            <br>

                            <p>The <span class="emphasize_red"> navigation bar</span> prominently features icons for adding books, accessing shelves, and managing profiles, to help streamlining user actions.</p>

                            <p>The <span class="emphasize_red">modern design</span> includes cleaner, more appealing aesthetics with an updated color palette and rounded edges. I demonstrated the theme in a dark mode because many users requested this.</p>

                            <p>The <span class="emphasize_red">social features</span> prototype focuses on book clubs, user profiles with activity updates, and in-app messaging, making it easier for users to connect and interact.</p>

                            <p>The <span class="emphasize_red">recommendation algorithm</span> is designed to reflect user preferences, offering personalized book suggestions based on their history, genre preferences, and friends' recommendations.</p>

I found this platform innovative, although the results, while impressive, were not what I was looking for when it came to my Goodreads redesign. For this reason, I designed the app without the use of AI help. The interface of Uizard itself was very intuitive, and I enjoyed becoming familar with this new up and coming design platform. </p>

In my redesign, I made sure to <span class="emphasize">enlarge the book covers to add color, and created a pop of teal throughout the interface</span> to bring some life to it. Rounded corners throughout the interface help create a more inviting design than the original app’s harsh corners.

                                <p> This user flow <span class="emphasize">-discovering a new book and adding it to a shelf—</span> is critical for user engagement on a platform like Goodreads. Many users rely on Goodreads to track their reading and organize books, so ensuring this process is as smooth and intuitive as possible can significantly impact user satisfaction.<br>

                                    <p class="small_teal_header"> Key reasons for choosing this flow for testing:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Frequency of Use: Adding books to shelves is a common action that users perform frequently. Any improvement here could have a big impact on the app's usability and the user’s overall experience.</li>
                                    <li>Reducing Friction: Interviews and surveys showed that users felt overwhelmed by too many options or steps, leading to friction in the book-adding process. Testing a streamlined option (Version B) can reveal if a quicker, more focused flow leads to greater satisfaction.</li>
                                    <li>Balancing Simplicity and Functionality: Version A offers more options upfront, but it may clutter the interface and slow down the process. Version B reduces visual clutter and simplifies the action, which may be more efficient but needs to be tested to ensure it doesn’t sacrifice functionality.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <br>

                                <p><span class="emphasize">Ease of Use: </span> Most users found the interface relatively intuitive, but many noted that they had to pause to ensure they selected the correct button. There was a common sentiment that the screen felt cluttered and that the multiple options could be overwhelming.</p>
                                <p><span class="emphasize">Shelf Selection Process:</span> Users generally found it easy to select shelves but felt that the multiple steps involved added complexity. A few users mentioned that the extra options (like adding to multiple shelves) were beneficial, although some thought they weren’t necessary for their typical use.</p>
                                <p><span class="emphasize">Control and Flexibility:</span> The option to add to multiple shelves was appreciated by some, but several users felt that it wasn’t necessary for every use case. The sentiment was split—some users valued the control, while others found it excessive.</p>
                                <p><span class="emphasize">Suggestions for Improvement:</span> Users suggested reducing steps, improving the visual hierarchy of buttons, and making the "Add to Shelves" button more prominent.</p>

                                <br>

                            <h3><b>results from user flow (b)</b></h3>
                                <br>

                                <p><span class="emphasize_red">Ease of Use:</span> All users found the Quick Add button easy to understand and appreciate the simplicity. Many described the process as “streamlined” and “clear,” with fewer opportunities for confusion compared to Version A.</p>
                                <p><span class="emphasize_red">Shelf Relevance:</span> Most users were happy with the suggested shelves in the modal. However, some noted that it would be beneficial if they could customize which shelves appear in the Quick Add options based on their needs.</p>
                                <p><span class="emphasize_red">Flexibility:</span> Users generally did not find the limited number of shelves restrictive. The "See More" button was reassuring for those who wanted to access less-used shelves, indicating that additional options were available if needed.</p>
                                <p><span class="emphasize_red">Preference for Streamlined Interface:</span> Users overwhelmingly preferred the Quick Add approach, mentioning that it minimized decision fatigue and provided a more convenient experience.</p>

                        <p> <span class="emphasize">Yes,</span>the hypothesis that users would prefer Version B due to its simplicity and convenience proved to be accurate. The majority of users expressed a preference for the streamlined Quick Add functionality in Version B, as it reduced the number of steps and presented a cleaner interface.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p><span class="emphasize">User satisfaction</span> was higher for Version B, with users describing it as "easy," "streamlined," and "clear." Version A had mixed reviews; while some users valued the control it provided, others found it overwhelming or felt that certain options weren’t necessary for their use case. Overall, users seemed more content with the convenience and efficiency of Version B.</p>

                            <p>Some users suggested that being able to <span class="emphasize">customize which shelves appeared in the Quick Add modal would further enhance usability.</span> This was an interesting suggestion that wasn’t anticipated and could potentially make the flow even more personalized.</p>
                                <br>
                            <p>Another insight was that a few users in Version A <span class="emphasize">liked having the option to add to multiple shelves, even if they didn’t use it often.</span> This implies that a balance of simplicity with flexible options could be beneficial in future designs.</p>
                                <br>
                            <p>One user noted that it would be helpful to <span class="emphasize">see which friends have read the book,</span> hinting at a potential social integration element that could add value to the experience.</p>

                                <br>

                                <p>This was my first time using AI so extensively for a UX project and I was very impressed by its ability to <span class="emphasize">streamline the research process,</span> especially when it came to finding patterns in data. As designers, we can be biased, and using AI helped me <span class="emphasize">see past my preferences and understand what the users were telling me based on their responses.</span> In the future, I plan to continue using AI for data driven projects such as this one and would encourage my future employers to implement it into their own UX/UI design processes as well.</p>
